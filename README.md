My Folio Website: https://sarathadhi.netlify.app/

I got inspired by Codetantra which is a online platform for writing exams. I made a quiz website where there are some restrictions for the user. If the user switches the tab, then it will be considered as mal-practice and the user is not allowed to write the exam. After finishing one question, then only the user is permitted to attend the next question. The interesting part here is all the questions are not stored in the database or not pre-programmed, all the questions are fetched from a spread-sheet using API. What ever changes made in the spread-sheet will reflect in the websites content. At the end of the exam the result is displayed.
